This workshop will be held at the [24th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation (ITSC)](https://2021.ieee-itsc.org/), planned for September 19-22, 2021 in Indianapolis, IN, United States.

## Contributions

Submissions are welcome via [papercept](https://its.papercept.net/). Please use our workshop code `798fn` for your submission. Submission deadline is March 31, 2021.
See [https://2021.ieee-itsc.org/workshops/](https://2021.ieee-itsc.org/workshops/) for details on the workshop paper submission.
Please get in touch with the organizers in case you have any further questions.

## Scope and Topics

The topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to,
- Cooperative and comprehensible motion planning
- Probabilistic decision making and motion planning (including MDPs, POMDPs, MMDPs)
- Probabilistic behavior prediction (with help of semantic high definition maps)
- Evaluation and benchmarking for probabilistic prediction
- Evaluation and benchmarking for comprehensible motion planning
